Status overlay for OBS Studio
=============================


Introduction
------------

This simple script was created to provide an overlay displaying the status of the OBS Studio.

When streaming an fullscreen content and only one screen is available, or for any other reason it is not possible to see the OBS Studio window itself, it is the place when this script cames into the action.
It provides minimalistic text overlay that contains basic OBS Studio status information.


Installation
-----------

To install the script, download [it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/majkrzak/obs-status-overlay/master/status-overlay.py) and save on your local. Next, in the OBS Studio, go to _Tools -> Scripts_. In the opened dialog click on the _+_ button and provide a patch where you saved the script. It should now be active, and the overlay should be visible in the top left corner of your screen.


Configuration
-------------

In the right panel of the scripts dialog, you can configure a couple of script's parameters. Currently, it is Font face, size, and color.


Contribution
-----------

This is the very initial version of this script. Therefore, I wrote in in a way that it should be relatively easy to be extended with new features.

Feel free to contribute by reporting the issues or dropping suggestions of the new features. Pull requests will of course be appreciated.
